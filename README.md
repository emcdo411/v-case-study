## üß† Case Study: Tech, Power & Surveillance in 2025

**J.D. Vance, Peter Thiel & Palantir's Rise to Influence**

> **Author's Note:** This case study is non-partisan and grounded in open-source data, legal filings, and government contracts. It investigates political branding, tech-aligned campaign financing, and emerging AI surveillance infrastructure.

---

### üìå Executive Summary

This investigation explores the 2025 convergence of political ascent and technological surveillance via:

* J.D. Vance‚Äôs rise from memoirist to Vice President of the United States
* The financial and ideological influence of billionaire Peter Thiel
* Palantir Technologies‚Äô \$938M+ in AI surveillance contracts across U.S. federal agencies

We use timelines, graph visualizations in R, and a dual-lens approach (technical and non-technical) to clarify how political narratives, venture capital, and AI-powered tools shape governance and civil liberties.
